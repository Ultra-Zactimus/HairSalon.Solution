# _Eau Claire's Salon: My 10th Code Review at Epicodus_

#### By Zachary Green

#### _This project is a demonstation of using mySQL Server/Workbench to create a database to store and pull data into a web application for a Salon business owner. The program uses Classes and Microsoft Entity to create Objects and then push/pull them to and from a database. This project was possible under the guidance of Epicodus https://www.epicodus.com/_

## Technologies Used

* `C#`
* `Microsoft Entity`
* `ASP.NET Core MVC`
* `Bootstrap`
* `CSS`

## Description

_Hair Salon owner Eau Claire needs a website that will allow them to keep track of their Stylists and the Clients each Stylist is in charge of. They need to be able to add and remove new Stylists and add Clients to specific Stylists. This application is a simulation into adding and removing these feature._
